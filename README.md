# INB344 - Search Engines Technology

This repository contains all class activities for QUT's INB344 Search Engines Technology, which I attended on the 2nd semester of 2015.

You might be more interested in Search Engines the apllied results rather than on the material developed throughout the semester. In this case, see the ```project/``` folder. This folder containts the unit's final project, in which I (as well as the other students) developed a tunned version of Terrier (one of the search engines at choice) to perform health-related queries on a selected corpus and then evaluated the obtained results and discussed them.

The remaining folders contain code developed related to the week's subject. Some classes on the code refer to the ```corpus``` folder, which is present on this repository as the file ```corpus.zip``` (a **lot** of HTML file â€“ seriously, more than 3k files).
