#Week 5 Acitivities

This week didn't include mandatory code. So the files are related to experimentations with Terrier 4.0. The file contents are:

- run_lmbasetuning: contains the modified version of the bash script to run the Language Model. It has to be on the root of terrier folder;

- steps.sh: is a bash that clears previous indexing, replaces the default configs file by another one that is written to read TREC collection and
runs the indexing process;

- mu_results.zip: contains the output generated by terrier when parsing queries using the lmbasetuning bash;

- td_idf_results.zip: same as the previous file, but when using the TF*IDF model
